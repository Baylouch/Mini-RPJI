  questTitle: Green and purple ghosts
  questDescription: Hello to you, the consulate sent me here to exorcise these places
    full of ghosts. They are more powerful than I thought ... I have an idea, what
    if we combine our strengths? We should start by exorcising those of green and
    purple color. Above all, be precise, you have to eliminate them in a certain
    order.
