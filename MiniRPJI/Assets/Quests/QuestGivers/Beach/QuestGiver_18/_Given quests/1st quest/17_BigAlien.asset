  questDescription: As we meet again, I've been studying this portal for a while
    now. I think I know why we can't use it. His energy is related to a powerful
    thing ... Maybe their leader? I don't know ... Anyway, I can feel the energy
    going east from here. Find what is there, and we may be able to find out what
    this portal is for.
