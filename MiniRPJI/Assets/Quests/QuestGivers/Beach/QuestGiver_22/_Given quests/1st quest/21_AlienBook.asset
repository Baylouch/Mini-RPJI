  questDescription: What are you doing here ? This place is top secret! I am a member
    of the kingdom's secret forces. Well if you got there, you're strong enough that
    I want you by my side. We found a flying saucer, the aliens seem to have abandoned
    it. Yet it makes noise and looks functional. If only we could retrieve a document
    or something allowing us to understand how to use it ... You want to help me
    in my research?
