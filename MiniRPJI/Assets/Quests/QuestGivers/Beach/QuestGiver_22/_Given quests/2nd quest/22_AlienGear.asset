  questDescription: Excellent work ! I don't understand everything but there is a
    pictorial part, I think I understand where the problem with this saucer comes
    from. I would need materials like this. It's a kind of "trouble-shoot" they've
    created, I think some aliens should have some on them. After that, we can make
    the saucer work, I'm sure!
