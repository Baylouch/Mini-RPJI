  questDescription: Hi, do you know? The aliens have landed! They are not that smart,
    but dangerous yes! They restricted us access to the first two parts of this area.
    If you want to go further, you will first have to go to part 2 to find their
    leader. Head north, take the path that will be most east. Keep walking and take
    the entrance that will be furthest south.
