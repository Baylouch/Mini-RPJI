  questDescription: Hello, my name is Lucy. I'm here because I'm looking for my diamond
    ... Did you see it? ... If it's mine? Yes of course. Finally ... I deserved it
    for sure! I worked for the royal family for years. And my little brother stole
    an apple one day from the kitchens. This idiot got caught! The king did not want
    to know anything and we must consider ourselves "happy" that he did not cut off
    his hands ... Pfff ... Are you going to help me or not?
