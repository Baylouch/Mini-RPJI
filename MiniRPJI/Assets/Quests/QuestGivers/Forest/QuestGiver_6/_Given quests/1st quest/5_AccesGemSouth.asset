  questTitle: Access gem
  questDescription: Ah, I heard about you, you are the apprentice ranger aren't you?
    You may have noticed that the available areas are quite limited at the moment.
    It is because of the monsters, they have stolen magic gems from us allowing access
    to these areas. I felt the southern access gem not far from here. Can you help
    me find her?
