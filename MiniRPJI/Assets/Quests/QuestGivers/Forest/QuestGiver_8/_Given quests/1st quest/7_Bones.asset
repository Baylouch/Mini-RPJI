  questDescription: Hello my good ranger. I am Loret an old man who was chased out
    of the village ... Since then I wander and I try to survive as I can ... Have
    you seen this cave south of here? One evening there was a deafening noise coming
    from there, and the cave appeared as if by magic. I found a bone not far from
    it and noticed that the monsters didn't attack me when I pointed it in the face.
    Could you help a poor old man like me and bring me some? You would help me a
    lot to end my old days more calmly.
